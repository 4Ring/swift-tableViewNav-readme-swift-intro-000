## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to...

* Create content when we have a sense at what exactly was presented to the student here.

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
* Can work with dictionaries 
* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows how to work with optionals
* Classes
* Structs
* Properties


## Outline / Notes

*  The student understands how to work with a very basic `UITableViewController`. They also know how they should work with a TableView, but there were only exposed to this once (so far), the once being the lesson prior to this one.
  
* Walk them through the necessary steps of creating a `UITableViewController` again. I love screenshots, include screenshots of these steps.

* The screenshots should coincide with the project I included with this repo. It's a completed project that lists the various songs from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. Don't be afraid to use some dirty dancing gifs in this one:

* Present the problem with which `UINavigationController` solves before jumping right into creating one!
* When then showing them how to create a `UINavigationController`, do so as if you're explaining it to a five year old, include screenshots.
* The method I want to show them in creating a `UINavigationController` is as follows:
* Select the `UITableViewController` in Interface Builder

* Editor --> Embed In --> Navigation Controller

* I changed title of nav bar in Interface Builder (which is something we should show the student), should we also show them how to do this in `viewDidLoad()`? I'm willing to discuss this, it's important for them to know this, maybe this is thrown into a future lesson.
